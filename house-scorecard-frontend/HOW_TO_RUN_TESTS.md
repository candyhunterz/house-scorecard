# How to Run Tests - House Scorecard

This document provides comprehensive instructions for running all automated tests in the House Scorecard application.

---

## 📋 **Prerequisites**

Before running E2E tests, ensure the following are set up:

1. **Backend server running** (Django)
2. **Frontend dev server running** (Vite)  
3. **Test user account** with credentials:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `password`

### Start the Application

You'll need **3 terminal windows**:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend Server
cd house-scorecard-backend  
python manage.py runserver

# Terminal 2 - Frontend Dev Server
cd house-scorecard-frontend
npm run dev

# Terminal 3 - Run Tests (after above are running)
cd house-scorecard-frontend
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

---

## 🧪 **Frontend Unit Tests**

### Run All Unit Tests
```bash
cd house-scorecard-frontend
npm test
```

### Run Tests in Watch Mode
```bash
npm test -- --watch
```

### Run Specific Test File
```bash
npm test PropertyCard.test.jsx
```

### What Unit Tests Cover
- ✅ **Component rendering** (PropertyCard, PropertyList, Dashboard)
- ✅ **Context state management** (AuthContext)
- ✅ **User interactions** (filtering, sorting, form inputs)
- ✅ **Error handling** and loading states
- ✅ **Data formatting** and validation

---

## 🎭 **End-to-End Tests (Playwright)**

### Run All E2E Tests
```bash
cd house-scorecard-frontend
npm run test:e2e
```

### 🔍 **Run with Visual UI (Recommended)**
```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```
*This opens Playwright's test runner UI where you can see tests execute visually*

### 🐛 **Run in Debug Mode**
```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug
```
*Runs tests with debugging tools and step-by-step execution*

### 📱 **Run on Specific Browser**
```bash
# Chrome only
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Firefox only  
npx playwright test --project=firefox

# Safari only
npx playwright test --project=webkit

# All browsers
npx playwright test --project=chromium --project=firefox --project=webkit
```

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Error: Target page, context or browser has been closed"
```bash
# Make sure dev servers are running first
npm run dev  # In frontend directory
python manage.py runserver  # In backend directory
```

#### "Cannot find test files"
```bash
# Make sure you're in the frontend directory
cd house-scorecard-frontend
npm run test:e2e
```

#### "Login failed in tests"
```bash
# Verify test user exists in database
python manage.py createsuperuser
# Username: admin
# Password: password
```

#### Tests run too fast to see
```bash
# Use slow motion and headed mode
npx playwright test --headed --slow-mo=1000
```

#### Browser not installed
```bash
# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install
```

## 🎉 **Quick Start**

For a quick test run to verify everything works:

```bash
# 1. Start servers (2 terminals)
npm run dev                    # Frontend
python manage.py runserver     # Backend

# 2. Run tests (3rd terminal)
cd house-scorecard-frontend
npm run test:e2e:ui

# 3. In Playwright UI, click "Run all tests"
```

This will execute all tests visually, showing you exactly what the automation covers!

**📝 Note**: The E2E tests are designed to work with the exact workflows that were manually tested and verified working, including the specific Zealty.ca property listing (R3034077) that was successfully auto-filled and analyzed.
