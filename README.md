# House Scorecard App

A web application designed to help users objectively compare and score potential houses based on their personalized criteria (Must-Haves, Nice-to-Haves, Deal Breakers).

2.  **Backend:** A Django project serving as the API and data persistence layer.

## Features

**Frontend:**
*   User registration and login.
*   Add new property details (address, price, stats, notes, image URLs).
*   View properties list on a dashboard with enhanced search and filtering.
*   **Property Status Tracking**: Full pipeline management (Interested â†’ Viewing Scheduled â†’ Viewed â†’ Offer Made â†’ Under Contract â†’ Closed â†’ Passed).
*   **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by price, score, beds, baths, square footage, criteria status, and property status.
*   **Enhanced Search**: Real-time search across property addresses and notes.
*   View detailed information for a single property with status timeline.

*   Scoring logic implemented in the `Property` model with automatic recalculation.
*   **Full Status Support**: 7-stage property status pipeline with history tracking.
*   REST API endpoints for user management and all core models using Django Rest Framework and Simple JWT.

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <project-root-directory>
```

**2. Backend Setup**

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd house-scorecard-backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows (Git Bash/PowerShell):
# .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install backend dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Deployment

This project is configured for deployment with Render for the backend and Vercel for the frontend.

### Backend (Render)

1.  **Create a Render account:** Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and sign up.
2.  **Create a new PostgreSQL database:** In the Render dashboard, create a new database. Copy the "Internal Database URL".
3.  **Create a new Web Service:** In the Render dashboard, create a new web service and connect it to your GitHub repository.
4.  **Configure the Web Service:**
    *   **Build Command:** `./build.sh`
    *   **Start Command:** `gunicorn scorecard_project.wsgi`
    *   **Environment Variables:**
        *   `DATABASE_URL`: Paste the internal database URL you copied.
        *   `SECRET_KEY`: Generate a new, strong secret key.
        *   `SENTRY_DSN`: Your Sentry DSN for the backend.
        *   `PYTHON_VERSION`: `3.11.4` (or your Python version)

### Frontend (Vercel)

1.  **Create a Vercel account:** Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up.
2.  **Create a new project:** In the Vercel dashboard, import your project from your GitHub repository.
3.  **Configure the project:** Vercel will automatically detect that you're using Vite and configure the build settings for you.
4.  **Add Environment Variables:** In the project settings, add the following environment variables:
    *   `VITE_API_URL`: The URL of your deployed Render backend (e.g., `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api`).
    *   `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`: Your Sentry DSN for the frontend.
5.  **Deploy:** Click "Deploy".

**Important:** After deploying the frontend, remember to add your Vercel app's URL to the `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` list in the backend `settings.py` and redeploy the backend for the change to take effect.
